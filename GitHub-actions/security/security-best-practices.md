Below are some essential commands for handling `Security Best Practices` in GitHub Actions:

- **Use Dependabot for dependency updates**:
    ```yaml
    name: Dependabot Dependency Updates

    on:
      schedule:
        - cron: '0 0 * * 1' # Runs every Monday at 00:00 UTC

    jobs:
      dependabot:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: Run Dependabot
            uses: dependabot/fetch-metadata@v1
    ```

- **Scan code for vulnerabilities**:
    ```yaml
    name: Code Scanning

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      scan:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2

          - name: Run CodeQL Analysis
            uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v1
            with:
              category: 'security'
    ```

These commands are crucial for effectively managing security best practices in your GitHub Actions workflows.
